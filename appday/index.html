      We all play video games, from pong to Super Mario Bros. Here's the first game I ever played, which is called Captain Comic and was released in 1988. It ran on a floppy disk and I played it using MS-DOS. Games are fun to play. What if you could create your own games, for you and your friends to play? It's easier to get started than you think. I believe everyone in this room could make their first game in just a few hours.

      Every technology out there goes through the hype cycle. Everyone jumps onto it and wants to have impressive headlines which is why we inflate expectations. After a while we always realise that reality is not all rainbows and unicorns and the pendulum swings the other way. In the end we get to take the technology serious and see how it can be used productively. All of this is frustrating to techies but this is how marketing works. Just building something is not enough - you need to sell it, too.

      One of the barriers of HTML5 is hand-made. For years we've been trying to chase the dream of building one thing and make it behave the same everywhere. Instead of embracing the idea that anything on the web can make workable and then enhanced to be more comfortable for better and newer environments, we tried to shoehorn everything new into an existing outdated infrastructure.
